# To-do list app üìù
FAC23 final pre-apprenticeship project to create a to-do list app with a test driven development approach.
## User stories:
As a user, I want too...
- Add tasks to a list
- Check things off my list
- Delete things from the list
- Use the app without a mouse
- Filter out completed to-do's from my list
## Our approach
We committed to writing our tests before writing the app code and took a DOM manipulation approach to test our UI. In the app, elements are created dynamically in JS with user interaction.
